# Welcome to my example Next.js app, w/ a Mongo/Mongoose integration, project
This was my solution for a quick and dirty app that was required as a part of the interview process of a potential employer. It shows proficiency w/ modern React best practices, w/ the TailwindCSS-powered NextUI UI-toolkit, Next.js 14+ application structures, and a MongoDB integration using the Mongoose ODM library. 

*[Please Note] - The following was included in the original "take-home exercise" as requirements. Including spelling and grammar errors (w/ the name of The Company changed)*

## What are we looking for?
* You will work on the _spec_ below, and push working code to this repo
* This can be backend heavy (UI is a postman collection or curl commands) or frontend heavy (data is stored in memory and disappears on a reload) or a bit fullstack or a mobile app event.
* This is the only technical/coding round we have. Please show off your areas of depth or breadth.
* You will need to fill in the blanks and make reasonable assumptions where needed. We are not a "turn English into TypeScipt" kind of team, and there is always some abiguity to travese and sound technical/UX judgement to excercise.
* We are looking for your ability to create the right abstractions, leverage the right tools, and hear about your engineering philosophy along the way. 
* At the end of the process - you'll have a sense for what we are like to work with, and what we value and vice versa - your skills, strenghts and edges and how we can succeed together!

## What are we not looking for?
* There is no right or wrong answer or unit test suite to pass. There is a lot of different ways to do this well, and have fun along the way. 
* Production ready code - feel free to creatively cut corners 
* Specific tech stacks - we'll share the stack we use, but use your favorite stack or something new you wanted to try. Your call!
* Slides, diagrams or detailed readmes - a demo and a code is suffiencient most of the time

Feel free to expand the scope and delivery in any appropriate way... but we care most about meeting the basic requirements laid out below

## Project Spec
